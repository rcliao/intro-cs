# Introduction to Computer Science

An introduction to Computer Science for kids. The goal is to keep students 
interested by playing games while learning Computer Science.

I strongly believe that the best way to learn programming is to have fun. I, 
personally, learned a lot faster and better while I'm having fun doing it.

Therefore, I think the best way to get people to learn Computer Science is to 
give them a game to play while learning the basic Computer Science stuff behind
the scene. Once students are interested into the subect, then we, as instructor,
can start to explain more in depth.

## Background Story

I'm being asked by my sister to create a short lesson for her daughter to learn 
Computer Science. While it is interesting for me to collect some online resources 
to teach the lessson. It appears to me that is important to create a Github 
repository containing all the resources.

This repository contains all the thought, resources as well as the lesson I 
will be teaching in this upcoming short period of time for her daughter.

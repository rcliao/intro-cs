# Introduction to Computer Science

An intro to Computer Science for kids. The goal is to keep kids interested by playing games while learning Computer Science.

## Background Story

I'm being asked by my sister to create a short lesson for her daughter to learn some Computer Science stuff. 
While it is interesting for me to collect some online resources to teach Computer Science stuff. It's probably
more interesting for me to create a repository to contain all the resources I found meanwhile.

This repository will contain all the thought, resources as well as the lesson I will be teaching in this upcoming short
period of time for her daughter.
